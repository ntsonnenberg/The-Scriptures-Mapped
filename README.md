# The-Scriptures-Mapped
Project 1 for IS 542 - Web Dev

## What I learned - HW 5

### I learned how powerful and useful immediately invoked function expressions can be. Using these functions and storing them in variables can help a developer get and manipulate data in the appropriate manner needed for a web application.
### I also learned how important it is to remember which variables are what. It's easy to lose track of what variables mean when there are so many and their names are similar. It took me a while to create the array of books in each object instead of another item within the volumes array. This was because I typed "volumes.books = volumeBooks;" instead of "volume.books = volumeBooks;". This small descrepency caused the array of book objects to be added to the volumes array instead of iterating through each volume object within the array and adding a books array within each object. Once I noticed this descrepency, I got my code to work properly.

## What I learned - Project 1

### There were definitely a lot of struggles during this project but I finally completed it. The hardest part was trying to integrate the Google Maps Javascript API into the code, especially when trying to pan and zoom to various markers that would appear in a chapter. I'm proud of the work I put in for the project. I think there is still a lot more to learn and this project really opened my eyes on how complex web development can be.
