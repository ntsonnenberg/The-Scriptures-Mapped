## What I learned - HW 5

### I learned how powerful and useful immediately invoked function expressions can be. Using these functions and storing them in variables can help a developer get and manipulate data in the appropriate manner needed for a web application.
### I also learned how important it is to remember which variables are what. It's easy to lose track of what variables mean when there are so many and their names are similar. It took me a while to create the array of books in each object instead of another item within the volumes array. This was because I typed "volumes.books = volumeBooks;" instead of "volume.books = volumeBooks;". This small descrepency caused the array of book objects to be added to the volumes array instead of iterating through each volume object within the array and adding a books array within each object. Once I noticed this descrepency, I got my code to work properly.
